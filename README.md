# About the Game
Good Vibrations is a Mixed Reality Game that allows the user to control the game using voice commands, keyboard, and mouse.
The player plays as a dog in the game and collects bones around the vibrant park setting filled with other dogs and their owners.
The game has upbeat music that fits the setting and is credited [here](https://github.com/johnshields/GoodVibrations-MR-Game/blob/main/workings/music_credits.md). Once all the bones are
collected, the game ends and loads back to the Main Menu.

* Developed with Unity ``2020.1.17f1`` and JetBrains Rider ``2020.3.3``
